# adr003-bdd-usage

## Context

We would like to use modern practices for QA and SDLC. We want to consider
using [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) in the project.

## Solution A

Use BDD on the project.

### Pros

- Strong collaboration between PO, Engineers and QA
- High visibility for project
- The software design follows business value

### Cons

- May require some Engineers and QA training to start using BDD

## Decision

We decided to go with Solution A and use BDD(tool will be defined later) in the project.
